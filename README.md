# University-Project-Allocation-System-DB

In, Miskatonic University, Philipp Howards took over the charge as the new Dean the school of Cthulhu Studies (CS) and he wanted to supplant the current system of assigning Final year Projects to the student with a newer and more efficient
system. A system that would keep satisfaction of to the students and the
Supervisors at the forefront. The goal was to ensure that we allow students to
provide preferences for the Projects that they are interested in by expressing up
to 20 projects and build a system that would assign each student a unique project
taking into consideration the preference expressed and his/her GPA. The Dean
wanted a system that would be fair to every student and yet ensure that everyone
is happy at the end of it. The entire system for allocation of the projects to student
comprises of many components such a front end that a student interacts and
where he/she expresses his preferences, a genetic algorim that takes all the data
and assigns each student a unique project ensuring that the student satisfaction is
ensured and a Data base that supports the entire system by providing necessary datastructure to store and retrivee the data.

## Goal
The primary goal of this projet is design a database that can store all the information about the students, the supervisors (teachers), and all the
information that would be needed by the Project Allocation System for assigning
of the projects to the students. The aim is to provide a supporting structure in the
form of a database to store d provide access to all the above mentioned
information with an ease that can be accessed by other components of the overall
system including the web-based interface
